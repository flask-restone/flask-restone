Flask-Restone
============

**Flask-Restone** is a powerful Flask extension for building RESTful JSON APIs.
Restone features include validation, model resources and routes, relations, object permissions, filtering, sorting,
pagination, signals, and automatic API schema generation.

Restone ships with backends for SQLAlchemy models.
It is possible to add backends for other data stores, or even to use a subset of Restone without any data store at all.
